Question: How do we get the ball rolling (need to get our initial centroids for each group):
1. Assign all images at random --> should work/converge
3. Could just select 10 random ones. 
2. Want to get 10 different intial conditions. Want them to be as different as possible at the beginning.



Multiple clusters:
- People write digits in different ways, so we can have multiple clusters for the same 'digit'. (EX: fives are written in diferetn ways)

Debugging Notes:
- Somehow the centroids are all turnign to 0s.
